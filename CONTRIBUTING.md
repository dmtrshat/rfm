# Contributing to RFM

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project ❤️

-   Fork rfm

-   Create your feature. Each new feature must be covered with a test. The tests are located in the [test_rfm.rs](https://github.com/dmtrshat/rfm/blob/main/tests/test_rfm.rs).

-   Commit your changes. Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

```
$ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
>
> A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
```

- Send pull request
