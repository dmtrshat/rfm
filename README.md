# **R**ust **F**ile **M**anager

> File manager, only inside Rust ü¶Ä

**`rfm`** is a convenient and intuitive way to interact with files on OS. Function naming is similar to Unix commands _(`ls`, `mkdir`, `mv`, `rm`, `cp`, `touch` etc.)_, so you can easily figure out how to use it.

## Installation

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
rfm = "0.5.0"
```

## Usage

For example:

```rust
extern crate rfm;
use std::{
    io::Result,
    path::{Path, PathBuf},
};

fn main() -> Result<()> {
    let dir_from_1 = Path::new("./tests/testing/mv").to_path_buf();
    let dir_from_2 = Path::new("./tests/testing/cp").to_path_buf();

    let dir_to = Path::new("./tests/testing/mkdir").to_path_buf();

    // check dir for existing files/dirs
    if rfm::ls(&dir_to)?.len() > 0 {
        // clean dir
        rfm::clean(&vec![&dir_to])?;
    }

    let need_to_move: Vec<&PathBuf> = vec![&dir_from_1, &dir_from_2];
    // Move some files/dirs
    rfm::mv(&need_to_move, &dir_to)?;

    Ok(())
}
```
